# LangChain Chatbot

Welcome to the LangChain Chatbot repository! This chatbot has been designed using the powerful capabilities of LangChain. Whether you want to set it up for personal use, development, or contribution, the following instructions will guide you through the process.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python Package Installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Using HTTPS:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/langchain-chatbot.git
   ```

   Or using SSH:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your_username/langchain-chatbot.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   
   ```bash
   cd langchain-chatbot
   ```

3. **Install the Dependencies**

   Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setting Up the Environment

Before running the chatbot, ensure you set up the environment variables appropriately.

1. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```
   # .env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key for LangChain and fill out any other environment variables that might be necessary.

2. **Load the Environment Variables**

   Make sure to load the environment variables in your application. If you're using a package like `python-decouple` or `python-dotenv`, this will be handled automatically.

## Running the Chatbot

Once you've set up your environment and installed all necessary dependencies, you can start the chatbot using:

```bash
python main.py
```

(Replace `main.py` with the appropriate entry file for your chatbot if it's different.)
